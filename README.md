# Angular Hexagonal Architecture

This projet is a simple Angular app using hexagonal architecture (or ports and adapters architecture) concepts. The rendering is the same as [Angular Tour of Heroes app](https://angular.io/tutorial), but code architecture is different. 

## Install dependencies

Run `npm install` to install node modules dependencies, before starting dev server.

## Development server

Run `npm start` to start the dev server with the original app, or npm run `start:admin-panel` to app with the admin panel interface. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
